# password_generator

    * converted existing code to include a function that would prompt a user for inputs and preferences on what to be used in the password
    * generates 8 to 128 character passwords for the user
    * uses not only uppercase and lowercase letters, but special characters and numbers as well to add extra security
    * simple design and strong red color so the user is not distracted and knows exactly what to press
